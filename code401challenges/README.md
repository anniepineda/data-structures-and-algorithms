Array Shift (code challenge 02)

# Insert and shift an array in middle at index
Write a function that equals insert shift array, that takes in an array and the value to be added, and returns an
array with new value added at the middle index. 

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of
the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

Binary Search (code challenge 03)

# Binary search in a sorted 1D array
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing 
any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the 
search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

# Implement a Queue using two Stacks 
### (code challenge 11)

   - [ ] Summary: Created a queue with two stacks.
   - [ ] Description: Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue 
   class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 
   2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:
               
     enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
     dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
     The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. 
     Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

# Multi-bracket Validation 
### (code challenge 13)

   - [ ] Summary: Created a queue with two stacks.
   - [ ] Description: Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:
                      
                      Round Brackets : ()
                      Square Brackets : []
                      Curly Brackets : {}

# Binary Tree and BST 
### (code challenge/lab 15)

   - [ ] Summary:  Binary Tree and BST 
   - [ ] Description:    Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, 
                         and the right child node.
                         
                         Create a BinaryTree class
                         Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder 
                         which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
                         
                         Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. 
                         For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw 
                         a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for 
                         this lab.
                         
                         Create a BinarySearchTree class
                         Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the 
                         correct location in the binary search tree.
                         Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether 
                         or not the value is in the tree at least once.
